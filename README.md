For the `frontend` section, we utilized the following frameworks:

1. React.js
2. Tailwind CSS

Regarding the `backend` aspect, our approach involved:

1. Implementing Express
2. Conducting unit tests
3. Utilizing Redis
4. Implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
5. Establishing a connection to Gmail

We employed `mongoose` and endeavored to deploy the application to the cloud.

I assume responsibility for the `frontend` development. Feel free to reach out to me if any issues arise.

P.S.
There may be instances of unoptimized code, attributable to an initially unclear division of work, particularly in the CSS. Furthermore, the coding style exhibits inconsistencies, making it somewhat intricate and confusing to navigate the codebase.
